	  <h4>A Framework to Evaluate Pipeline Reproducibility across Operating Systems</h4>
    <p>The lack of computational reproducibility threatens data science
    in several domains. In particular, it has been shown that different
    operating systems can lead to different analysis results. This
    study aims to identify and quantify the effect of the operating
    system on neuroimaging analysis pipelines. We developed a framework
    to evaluate the reproducibility of these neuroimaging pipelines
    across operating systems. The framework essentially leverages
    software containerization and system-call interception to record
    results provenance without having to instrument the pipelines. A
    tool (Repro-tools) was developed to compare results obtained in
    different conditions. We used our framework to evaluate the effect
    of the operating system on results produced by pipelines from the
    Human Connectome Project (HCP), a large open- data initiative to
    study the human brain. In particular, we focused on pre-processing
    pipelines for anatomical and functional data, namely PreFreeSurfer,
    FreeSurfer, Post- FreeSurfer and fMRIVolume. We used data from 5
    subjects released by the HCP. Re- sults highlight substantial
    differences in the output of the HCP pipelines obtained in two
    versions of Linux (CentOS6 and CentOS7). Inter-OS differences
    corresponding to normalized root mean square errors of up to 0.27
    were observed, which corresponds to visually important differences.
    We provide visualizations of the most important differences for
    various pipeline steps. No meaningful inter-run differences were
    observed, which shows that the inter-OS differences do not
    originate from the use of pseudo- random numbers or silent crashes
    of the pipelines. We hypothesize that the observed inter-OS
    differences come from numerical instabilities in the pipelines,
    triggered by rounding and truncation differences that originate in
    the update of mathematical libraries in different systems. An
    apparent solution to this issue is to freeze the execution
    environment using, for instance, software containers. However, this
    would only mask instabilities while they should ultimately be
    corrected in the pipelines.</p>

	  <h4>A New Algorithm to Split and Merge Ultra-High Resolution 3D Images</h4>
	  <p>Splitting and merging ultra-high resolution 3D images is a requirement for parallel or distributed
processing operations. Naive algorithms to split and merge 3D blocks from ultra-high resolution images
perform very poorly, due to the number of seeks required to reconstruct spatially-adjacent blocks from
linear data organizations on disk. The current solution to deal with this problem is to use file formats
that preserve spatial proximity on disk, but this comes with additional complexity. We introduce a new
algorithm called Multiple reads/writes to split and merge ultra-high resolution 3D images efficiently
from simple file formats. Multiple reads/writes write contiguously in the reconstructed image, which
leads to substantial performance improvements compared to existing algorithms. We parallelize our
algorithm using multi-threading, which further improves the performance for data stored on a Hadoop
cluster. We also show that on-the-fly lossless compression with the lz4 algorithm reduces the split and
merge time further. </p>

	  <div class="date">7 Nov 2017</div>
	  <p>We present Boutiques, a system to automatically publish, integrate and execute applications across computational platforms. Boutiques applications are installed through
software containers described in a rich and flexible JSON language. A set of core tools facilitate the construction, validation, import, execution, and publishing of applications.
Boutiques is currently supported by several distinct virtual research platforms, and it has been used to describe dozens of applications in the neuroinformatics domain. We expect
Boutiques to improve the quality of application integration in computational platforms, to reduce redundancy of effort, to contribute to computational reproducibility, and to foster
Open Science.</p>
